abstract: Cartoon faces are widely used in social media, animation production, and social robots because of their attractive ability to convey different emotional information. Despite their popular applications, the mechanisms of recognizing emotional expressions in cartoon faces are still unclear. Therefore, three experiments were conducted in this study to systematically explore a recognition process for emotional cartoon expressions (happy, sad, and neutral) and to examine the influence of key facial features (mouth, eyes, and eyebrows) on emotion recognition. Across the experiments, three presentation conditions were employed: (1) a full face; (2) individual feature only (with two other features concealed); and (3) one feature concealed with two other features presented. The cartoon face images used in this study were converted from a set of real faces acted by Chinese posers, and the observers were Chinese. The results show that happy cartoon expressions were recognized more accurately than neutral and sad expressions, which was consistent with the happiness recognition advantage revealed in real face studies. Compared with real facial expressions, sad cartoon expressions were perceived as sadder, and happy cartoon expressions were perceived as less happy, regardless of whether full-face or single facial features were viewed. For cartoon faces, the mouth was demonstrated to be a feature that is sufficient and necessary for the recognition of happiness, and the eyebrows were sufficient and necessary for the recognition of sadness. This study helps to clarify the perception mechanism underlying emotion recognition in cartoon faces and sheds some light on directions for future research on intelligent human-computer interactions.

### Study Overview: Emotional Recognition in Cartoon Faces

**Understanding Cartoon Emotion Recognition:** This study explores the influence of key facial features on the recognition of emotions in cartoon faces, a subject of growing interest in the field of affective computing. The research aims to understand how emotional expressions in cartoon faces are processed and recognized, which is crucial for developing more emotionally intelligent interactive systems.

### Methodological Approach

**Systematic Experimentation:** We conducted three experiments to systematically investigate the recognition process for emotional cartoon expressions, focusing on happy, sad, and neutral expressions. We examined the impact of key facial features—mouth, eyes, and eyebrows—on emotion recognition under different presentation conditions.

### Key Contributions

**Dataset Creation and Analysis:** A significant contribution of this work is the creation and analysis of a dataset that includes real and cartoon face images, providing a foundation for understanding the mechanisms of emotion recognition in cartoon faces.

**Facial Feature Influence:** The study reveals that the mouth is a key feature for recognizing happiness in cartoon faces, while eyebrows are crucial for recognizing sadness. These findings contribute to the understanding of how different facial features contribute to the perception of emotions in cartoon faces.

### Experimental Findings

**Emotion Recognition Advantage:** The research found that happy expressions in cartoon faces were recognized more accurately than neutral and sad expressions, aligning with the happiness recognition advantage observed in real face studies.

**Perception of Sadness:** Interestingly, sad expressions in cartoon faces were perceived as sadder than those in real faces, suggesting that cartoon faces may exaggerate emotional cues to a greater extent.

### Conclusion and Implications

**Enhancing Human-Computer Interaction:** By clarifying the perception mechanisms underlying emotion recognition in cartoon faces, this study sheds light on potential directions for future research and the development of intelligent human-computer interaction systems.
